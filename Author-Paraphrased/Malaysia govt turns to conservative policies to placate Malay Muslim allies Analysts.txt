Mr Dwindle Mumford, South-east Asia hone head of political hazard consultancy Eurasia Bunch, said:

Mr Anwar's government is too trusting to appear that opposite to restriction talk, the Chinese-based Majority rule Activity Party (DAP), a key component in PH, does not call the shots in his administration's decision-making.
