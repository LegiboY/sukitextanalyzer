In later months, there have been reports of a number of high-profile captures of people with near ties to political rivals of President Xi. Pundits contend that these captures are politically propelled and outlined to solidify control instead of truly combat corruption.

To address these concerns, the Chinese government has emphasized the significance of due process and the rule of law within the anti-corruption campaign.
