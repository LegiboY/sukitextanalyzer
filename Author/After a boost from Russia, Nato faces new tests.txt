Just three years ago, French President Emmanuel Macron publicly dismissed the Nato military alliance as “brain-dead”. Although many Western leaders were shocked by his undiplomatic outburst, quite a few privately shared his view that a military alliance put together during the Cold War was struggling to find a purpose.

Yet as heads of state and government of the 31 Nato member countries gather on Tuesday for their annual summit in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, even the harshest critics of the alliance can no longer deny its centrality in Europe’s security. They include Mr Macron, who is now a tireless promoter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s importance in deterring Russia.

But Nato’s most significant tests are yet to come even though it has rediscovered its purpose and done well in managing the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its member states still disagree on how it will manage European security after the Ukraine war ends, when the United States’ strategic focus shifts again primarily to Asia. Nato, in short, is a “work in progress”.

That said, it’s hard to overstate its achievements and enduring importance. It succeeded in deterring the Soviet Union from invading Western Europe until the Soviet Union itself collapsed in 1991. And, uniquely in modern history, it is a military alliance which continues to exist long after the purpose of its creation evaporated.

The West’s critics – particularly those in Moscow or Beijing – dismiss Nato’s longevity as just the outcome of America’s desire to dominate Europe.

But that’s just not true. Far from coercing countries into participating, Nato’s biggest problem is how to satisfy the clamour of more and more countries to join. The alliance has doubled in size since the Cold War. And nations continue to knock on Nato’s door for two chief reasons, one obvious and the other implicit.

The obvious reason is the US security guarantee; no other military alliance has benefited from such a comprehensive and practically quasi-automatic security guarantee.

But the implicit advantage provided by Nato – and one almost as significant, although seldom mentioned or noticed – is that joining the military alliance prevents individual European states from thinking about their security in purely national terms. A Europe without Nato would be one in which individual European states start scheming against one another by creating competing local alliances. Nato has eliminated all this; member states may have bilateral difficulties, but the idea of a military clash between them is now rightly dismissed as absurd.

As for the Russian threat, it is now largely forgotten that at the alliance’s 2010 summit, the guest of honour was none other than President Vladimir Putin. There were grand plans then to establish a Nato-Russia Council, a forum which, if Moscow took it seriously, could have become a significant conduit for a Russian voice in the continent’s security. Indeed, the Germans and the French were dreaming about precisely such an outcome.

A statue to Putin

But just as Mr Putin never understood that his easiest way of controlling Ukraine was by keeping the country dependent on the Russian economy rather than by seeking to conquer it, so he failed to see that Nato could also work to his advantage. There is no question that Nato leaders are guilty of many errors in handling Russia. Yet there is also no question that, by invading Ukraine, Mr Putin has guaranteed Nato’s survival for decades to come.

The Russian President has performed an even more outstanding service by clarifying the extent of the US security guarantee to Europe. The famed Article 5 in Nato’s founding treaty, the mutual security guarantee which declares that an attack on one state is an attack on the whole alliance, was never adequately defined; it merely says that should such an attack occur, member states will take “such action” as they “deem necessary, including the use of armed force”.

For decades, the Europeans wondered whether this meant the US would go to war on their behalf. Mr Putin has now helped clarify this crucial point: In response to the invasion of Ukraine, US President Joe Biden repeatedly vowed to defend “every inch” of alliance territory. “One day” – the joke went around Nato’s headquarters in Brussels – “we may need to erect a statue to Vladimir Putin.”

Understandably, therefore, alliance leaders are gathering for their summit on Tuesday in a confident mood. Nato survived its most significant test and came out of it with flying colours. True, it did not succeed in deterring Russia from invading Ukraine. But it is still deterring Russia daily; the Russian military is not attacking convoys of Western military supplies to Ukraine because Mr Putin knows this could mean war with Nato.

Furthermore, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has spurred two militarily potent and wealthy countries, Sweden and Finland, to join the Nato club. The treaty on Sweden’s Nato membership has yet to be ratified by Turkey and Hungary, but even if this hurdle is not eliminated this week, it is still only a matter of time before Sweden becomes a full member. When it does, the whole Baltic Sea on Europe’s northern approaches will effectively become a Nato lake, a significant blow to Russia’s strategic aspirations.

And then there is the newly found unity of purpose. The Germans no longer argue that Nato must avoid offending Russia’s sensibilities, to the anger of the East Europeans. And Mr Macron is no longer offering to mediate between Russia and the West despite widespread scepticism.

Looking ahead

Still, the good mood prevailing in Vilnius masks much tension and apprehension about the future.

The most significant and immediate question is what to do with Ukraine when the guns fall silent. Most Nato member states want to offer Ukraine full alliance membership. But the US remains unpersuaded, mainly because it does not wish to accept the risk of going to war in Ukraine’s defence before the country’s borders are fixed.

The matter will be fudged by holding out the prospect of a swift Ukrainian Nato membership at a later stage while offering the country massive military aid. But this assistance programme will be conducted on a bilateral level between individual states and Ukraine rather than by the alliance as a whole.

There is also the question of funding. Almost two decades after member states pledged to spend at least 2 per cent of their gross domestic product on their militaries, only seven countries – less than a quarter of the total – have met the target: Britain, the US, Greece, Poland and the three small Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

The defence expenditure of everyone else is still below that figure, with the Germans still expected to take years before they reach the target and Canada admitting that it never will hit the mark.

There are other failures. The Ukraine war has exposed the shockingly low ammunition stocks available in Europe. Yet almost 18 months after this became obvious, there is no Nato project to boost such stocks; all is taking place in an uncoordinated manner at the level of the member states.

The Asian question

Then there are the political tensions over Nato’s proposed outreach to Asia. The leaders of Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand will be present at the summit on Tuesday, as they were at the 2022 event. But a Nato plan to open a representative office in the Japanese capital Tokyo will be scuppered by a French veto.

Technically, the French are correct: Nato is about providing security in Europe and has no formal business in Asia. But it is odd to claim in one breath – as Mr Macron frequently does – that all security problems are global and then claim that a security alliance can be confined to just Europe.

Behind this debate lurks Nato’s long-term challenge: how to keep the US engaged in guaranteeing Europe’s security after this war is over, when the Americans’ attention is bound to return to Asia.

Whether Nato opens an office in Tokyo is irrelevant; the key question is whether the alliance learns to be helpful to the Americans in a more global sense or remains – at least as seen from Washington – a niche provider of just European security.

And although Mr Biden will undoubtedly go down in history as one of Nato’s greatest American supporters, the US leader is already serving notice that there are strict limits to his commitment.

The reason he turned down the candidature of British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace for the job of Nato’s next secretary-general is not that he personally dislikes the guy, but mainly because Mr Wallace has a reputation for being too vocal, and the White House has no interest in being lectured on what it needs to do next in Europe.

So, Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the current and long-serving Nato boss, has had his tenure extended by another year as Washington searches for a more pliant candidate. An odd outcome for an organisation that is otherwise thriving.

Meanwhile, the Europeans – the Germans, in particular – remain convinced that the current US investment in the continent’s defence will continue unhindered, even after Ukraine fades from public attention.

As a result, the Europeans continue to believe they can still somehow muddle through under the protective umbrella of America for years to come. Thus, Europe focuses primarily on trade abroad and the fairest possible distribution of wealth at home rather than providing for its own security.

Everyone talks about European “defence autonomy”. But few know what this means, and fewer still think about how much it will cost. The assumption in Europe is that the Americans are here to stay. But what if they don’t? The Europeans may be in for a rude awakening.

Yes, Nato has an excellent track record in proving its critics wrong. Still, past performance is not necessarily a guide to future success.
