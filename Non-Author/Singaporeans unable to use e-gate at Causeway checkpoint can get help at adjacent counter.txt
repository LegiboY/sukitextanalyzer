
Singaporeans Unable to Use E-Gate at Causeway Checkpoint Can Get Help at Adjacent Counter

SINGAPORE, December 10, 2023 â€“ In an effort to provide smoother and more efficient border crossings, Singapore's Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has implemented a new system to assist Singaporean travelers who face difficulties using the electronic gates (e-gates) at the Woodlands Causeway checkpoint.

The ICA's move comes as a response to the increasing number of travelers facing issues with e-gate usage, particularly the elderly and those with limited technological literacy. The new system will allow individuals who cannot use e-gates or need assistance to conveniently seek help at an adjacent counter.

The e-gate system, introduced several years ago, has played a pivotal role in streamlining the immigration process at major border checkpoints, including the Causeway checkpoint connecting Singapore to Malaysia. However, some citizens have experienced difficulties in using the technology, leading to delays and frustration.

Mr. Tan Wei, a frequent traveler who has faced e-gate issues in the past, praised the new initiative. "I often travel to Malaysia for business, and the e-gates have caused me problems more than once. It's great to know that there's a dedicated counter nearby where I can get assistance without holding up the line for others," he said.

The ICA's decision to establish a dedicated counter for Singaporeans who require assistance with their border crossing process is expected to alleviate congestion at the checkpoint and improve the overall traveler experience. The counter is strategically located next to the e-gates, ensuring that travelers can quickly access the help they need without disrupting the flow of traffic.

ICA spokesperson, Ms. Lim Mei Ling, emphasized the authority's commitment to providing excellent service for all travelers. "We understand that not everyone is familiar with technology, and it can be intimidating for some travelers, especially the elderly. Our goal is to ensure that every traveler, regardless of their level of technological proficiency, can enjoy a smooth and efficient border crossing experience," she explained.

To use the new assistance counter, Singaporean travelers simply need to approach the designated counter, where trained personnel will be available to assist them with their immigration clearance. The personnel will guide travelers through the necessary steps, including the scanning of passports and identity verification.

In addition to providing assistance with e-gate usage, the new counter will offer support for individuals who may have forgotten their passports, are traveling with young children, or have other specific needs. This initiative aligns with Singapore's commitment to being a traveler-friendly nation.

The ICA has also taken steps to inform travelers about the new service. Signs and notices have been placed prominently at the checkpoint to ensure that Singaporeans are aware of the assistance counter and its location. Travelers can also find information about the counter on the ICA's official website and through social media channels.

The response from the public has been largely positive, with many expressing their gratitude for the ICA's efforts to make travel more accessible to all citizens. Several travelers shared their experiences on social media, with one user tweeting, "Great to see Singapore's immigration authorities stepping up to help citizens who struggle with technology. It's a small change that will make a big difference!"

While the introduction of the assistance counter is a significant step forward, the ICA remains committed to improving its services further. Ms. Lim Mei Ling stated that the authority is actively exploring ways to enhance the e-gate system's user-friendliness and is considering additional support measures such as instructional videos and dedicated helplines.

As Singapore continues to position itself as a global travel hub, the ICA's dedication to providing exceptional service to its citizens and visitors alike is crucial. The introduction of the assistance counter at the Causeway checkpoint is a testament to Singapore's commitment to ensuring that every traveler can cross its borders with ease and efficiency.

Singaporean travelers can now look forward to a more convenient and hassle-free experience at the Woodlands Causeway checkpoint, thanks to the ICA's efforts to address e-gate usage challenges. The establishment of the dedicated assistance counter is a positive step towards creating a more inclusive and traveler-friendly border crossing process.
