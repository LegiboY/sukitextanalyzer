New Delhi/Moscow, â€“ In a significant diplomatic development, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended a warm welcome to Iran's inclusion in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) during a summit held in New Delhi. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized the importance of maintaining unity within the organization as Iran officially became its newest member.

The SCO, a regional alliance that was initially formed in 2001 as the Shanghai Five, comprises eight member states: China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Its primary objectives include enhancing regional security, promoting economic cooperation, and fostering cultural exchanges among its member states.

Iran's accession to the SCO comes at a time of shifting geopolitical dynamics in the region. The move has been met with mixed reactions from various member countries, with India's welcoming stance and Russia's call for unity standing out as two contrasting positions within the organization.

Prime Minister Modi, in his opening remarks at the summit, expressed his delight at Iran's entry into the SCO, describing it as a "milestone moment" for the organization. He highlighted the potential for enhanced regional cooperation in various fields, including trade, energy, and counterterrorism efforts, with Iran's participation.

Modi stated, "Iran's membership not only adds to the cultural and civilizational richness of the SCO but also expands our collective strength in addressing regional and global challenges. We look forward to working closely with Iran to achieve the shared goals of peace and prosperity."

Iran's inclusion in the SCO has raised questions about the organization's balance of power and dynamics. While India's warm reception of Iran's membership reflects its desire to deepen economic and strategic ties with the Middle Eastern nation, Russia, which has historically maintained a close relationship with Iran, expressed concerns over maintaining unity within the SCO.

President Putin emphasized the need for cohesion within the organization, saying, "The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has been successful due to its unity and consensus among member states. While we welcome Iran's participation, it is essential that we continue to work together effectively to address regional challenges."

The Russian leader's comments were perceived as a reminder to member states to prioritize the organization's unity above bilateral interests. Russia has traditionally played a key role in shaping the SCO's agenda, and Putin's statement reflects Moscow's commitment to maintaining its influence within the organization.

China, another major player in the SCO, has been cautiously supportive of Iran's accession. Chinese President Xi Jinping, while acknowledging Iran's significance in the region, echoed the importance of unity within the organization.

"We value Iran's role in regional stability and development," President Xi stated. "At the same time, it is crucial that we work together harmoniously within the SCO framework to achieve our common objectives."

Pakistan, another South Asian member of the SCO, has also welcomed Iran's membership, emphasizing the potential for increased economic and trade cooperation.

The inclusion of Iran in the SCO comes at a time when the region is facing several pressing challenges, including the situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban's takeover has raised concerns about security and stability. The SCO has a critical role to play in addressing these challenges, making unity among its member states more critical than ever.

The summit in New Delhi provided an opportunity for member states to discuss these regional issues and outline a collaborative approach to tackle them. While India's enthusiastic welcome for Iran's entry reflects its eagerness to strengthen ties with Tehran, Russia's insistence on unity underscores the delicate balance of power within the organization.

As Iran formally becomes a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the future trajectory of the SCO will depend on the ability of its member states to find common ground and work together effectively in addressing the complex challenges facing the region. Iran's inclusion adds a new dimension to the organization's dynamics, making it a pivotal moment for regional diplomacy and cooperation. The world will be watching closely to see how the SCO navigates this new chapter in its history.
