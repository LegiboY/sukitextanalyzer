New Delhi, India - December 11, 2023

In a significant leap forward in its space exploration endeavors, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) successfully launched seven satellites, all manufactured in collaboration with Singaporean space technology companies. The historic launch, which took place today from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, marked a milestone in India's commitment to international space cooperation and its growing role in the global space industry.

The launch vehicle, a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C55), gracefully lifted off at 10:30 AM IST under clear skies. The seven satellites aboard the rocket were jointly developed by ISRO and Singapore's leading space tech companies, showcasing a testament to India's burgeoning prowess in satellite manufacturing and launch capabilities.

The primary payload of the mission, named "SingSat," is a state-of-the-art Earth observation satellite equipped with advanced imaging sensors and communication systems. SingSat will play a crucial role in monitoring climate change, weather patterns, and disaster management, offering valuable data for both India and Singapore. It will orbit the Earth at an altitude of 500 kilometers, providing high-resolution imagery and data to aid various sectors, including agriculture, forestry, and urban planning.

Speaking at a press conference after the successful launch, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, ISRO's Chairman, stated, "This mission is a testament to the close collaboration between India and Singapore in space technology. SingSat will not only benefit both nations but also contribute to the global understanding of climate change and disaster management."

The six secondary payloads included three nanosatellites, two microsatellites, and one CubeSat, all serving diverse purposes and demonstrating India's increasing versatility in space technology. One of the secondary payloads, the "SGTech-1," is a microsatellite designed for maritime surveillance and the tracking of vessels in the busy waters surrounding Singapore. It is expected to enhance security and safety in the region by providing real-time monitoring and information sharing capabilities.

Another notable secondary payload is the "SGLink," a nanosatellite developed for space-based communications research. It aims to test new communication technologies that could potentially improve satellite-to-satellite communication and data transmission between Earth and spacecraft. The advancements made by SGLink could have far-reaching implications for future space missions, including deep space exploration.

The successful launch of these seven satellites represents a significant step forward in India's efforts to become a hub for satellite manufacturing and launch services. ISRO has been actively promoting its "Make in India" initiative, encouraging the development of domestic space technology and fostering collaborations with international partners. The partnership with Singaporean space technology companies exemplifies the success of this initiative.

Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who witnessed the launch remotely, expressed his enthusiasm for the joint venture. In a statement, Prime Minister Lee said, "Today's launch marks a historic milestone in our friendship and cooperation with India in the field of space technology. The satellites launched today will not only benefit our countries but also contribute to global advancements in space exploration."

The success of the PSLV-C55 mission also underscores India's commitment to fulfilling its international obligations in space exploration. The launch adheres to the principles of the Outer Space Treaty, which promotes the peaceful use of outer space and the responsible management of space activities.

As India continues to expand its capabilities in space technology, the world watches with anticipation. ISRO's successful launch of seven Singapore-made satellites demonstrates the country's growing influence in the global space industry and its dedication to international cooperation in advancing our understanding of the universe and addressing global challenges. With ambitious missions on the horizon, including lunar and Mars exploration projects, India's presence in space is set to grow stronger in the coming years, opening new opportunities for scientific research, technological advancements, and international collaboration.
