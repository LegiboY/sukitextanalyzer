In a historic ceremony that blended tradition with modernity, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the new and larger Parliament building on Friday, marking a significant milestone in the nation's democratic journey. However, the event was marred by the absence of several opposition parties, which had decided to boycott the ceremony in protest.

The grand inauguration, which coincided with Constitution Day, saw the Prime Minister laying the foundation stone for the new Parliament building back in 2020. After years of construction and meticulous planning, the magnificent structure now stands as a symbol of India's commitment to democracy and progress.

The new Parliament building, designed by renowned architect Bimal Patel, is a testament to India's vision for the future while respecting its rich heritage. The circular structure, with its striking dome and extensive use of Indian architectural elements, is expected to accommodate more legislators, staff, and advanced technology facilities to support the legislative process.

In his inaugural address, Prime Minister Modi stated, "Today is a momentous day in the history of India. This new Parliament building is a shrine of democracy, a place where our elected representatives will come together to shape our nation's destiny. It reflects our rich history and our aspirations for a brighter future."

However, the absence of key opposition parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Trinamool Congress, hung like a shadow over the event. These parties had chosen to boycott the ceremony to protest the government's handling of various issues, including the recent controversial farm bills and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rahul Gandhi, leader of the Indian National Congress, tweeted, "I stand in solidarity with the farmers and all those who have been marginalized by this government. We cannot celebrate when our fellow countrymen are suffering."

Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal and leader of the Trinamool Congress, echoed similar sentiments, saying, "We must prioritize the needs of the people over grand celebrations. The government should focus on addressing the concerns of the farmers and the common man."

The opposition's decision to boycott the event led to a tense political atmosphere. It also sparked a debate about the role of symbolism in governance. While the government argued that the inauguration was an important event for the country's development, critics saw it as an attempt to divert attention from pressing issues.

Despite the boycott, the event itself was a spectacle of Indian culture and heritage. It showcased various traditional dances, music, and art forms, symbolizing the unity in diversity that is India's strength. The ceremony also featured a 'Deep Prajvalan' where Prime Minister Modi and other dignitaries lit traditional lamps, signifying the dispelling of darkness and the advent of knowledge and wisdom.

The new Parliament building, constructed at an estimated cost of â‚¹971 crore (approximately $130 million), is a part of the ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project, which aims to rejuvenate the heart of India's capital city, New Delhi. The project has been a subject of controversy and debate since its inception, with opponents arguing that it is a misallocation of resources given the country's pressing socio-economic challenges.

In response to these criticisms, the government has maintained that the project is essential for modernizing the country's administrative infrastructure and providing state-of-the-art facilities to lawmakers. The new Parliament building, with its advanced technology and increased seating capacity, is expected to enhance the efficiency of the legislative process.

As India enters a new era with its larger and more modern Parliament building, it faces the challenge of bridging political divides and addressing the concerns of a diverse and complex nation. The boycott by opposition parties serves as a reminder that even as India celebrates its achievements, it must also heed the voices of dissent and work towards a more inclusive and equitable future.
