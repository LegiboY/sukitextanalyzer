Could Xi’s Successor Emerge When China Appoints Its New Vice-President This Weekend?

Beijing, China – December 10, 2023

As China prepares for the appointment of its new vice-president this weekend, speculation is rife about whether the choice will offer any hints about President Xi Jinping's successor. The position of vice-president in China is often seen as a stepping stone to the country's top leadership, and this upcoming appointment is generating intense interest both within the country and abroad.

President Xi Jinping, who has been at the helm of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, is currently serving his third term as president. However, the Chinese Constitution limits the president to two consecutive terms, raising questions about his successor and the direction of Chinese leadership.

The role of vice-president in China is more than just ceremonial. While the vice-president does not have the same level of authority as the president, they play a crucial role in diplomacy, representing China on the international stage, and often engage in high-level discussions with foreign leaders. Moreover, the vice-president is part of China's top leadership circle and could potentially ascend to the presidency in the future.

Several candidates have been rumored to be in contention for the position of vice-president, and the selection process is closely guarded by the Chinese Communist Party. Some experts believe that the choice of the new vice-president could offer insights into the power dynamics within the party and the direction of China's future leadership.

One name frequently mentioned in speculation is Li Keqiang, the current Premier of the State Council. Li has a strong track record of economic management and has been a prominent figure in Chinese politics for years. His elevation to the vice-presidency could signal a continuation of the current leadership's policies, emphasizing economic growth and stability.

Another potential candidate is Wang Yang, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Wang has been praised for his pragmatic approach and is seen as a moderate voice within the party. His appointment as vice-president could indicate a shift towards a more conciliatory approach to foreign relations and domestic policy.

On the other hand, some observers suggest that President Xi may choose a candidate who is more aligned with his own vision for China's future. This could include individuals who are known for their loyalty to Xi and his policies. If such a candidate were to be appointed as vice-president, it might signal President Xi's intention to maintain a strong influence over Chinese politics even after his presidential term ends.

The selection of the new vice-president is expected to be announced at the upcoming session of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislative body. The NPC is a carefully orchestrated event, and the choice of vice-president will have been made after extensive behind-the-scenes deliberations within the party's top leadership.

The speculation surrounding the vice-presidential appointment is also being closely watched by the international community. China's role in global politics and the direction of its foreign policy have far-reaching implications, and any change in leadership could have a significant impact on international relations.

In recent years, China has faced increasing scrutiny and criticism on various fronts, including its human rights record, trade practices, and territorial disputes. The country's stance on issues such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea has led to tensions with other nations, including the United States. The selection of a new vice-president with a different approach to these matters could potentially signal a shift in China's foreign policy priorities.

While the appointment of a new vice-president may not provide definitive answers about President Xi's successor, it will undoubtedly offer valuable insights into the current state of Chinese politics and the direction in which the country is headed. As the weekend approaches, all eyes will be on Beijing as China prepares to unveil its new vice-president and, perhaps, provide a glimpse of what lies ahead for this global powerhouse.
